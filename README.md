### Hi there 👋

My name's Alice and after working in e-commerce for the past 5 years, I've decided to pursue my dream to become a Front-End / Web Developer!<br/><br/>
I'm currently studying on the **Web Development Bootcamp** with HyperionDev which is due to finish in March 2023. <br/>
By the end of the bootcamp, I will have learnt how to build and design dynamic, data driven web applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React** and **Node**, and gained valuable experience working both independently and collaboratively to debug code and problem-solve. 

#### Some of the things we have learnt so far are:
- JavaScript 
  - Object-oriented and defensive programming
  - Control structures
  - Higher order functions
  - Recursion
  - APIs
  - Asynchronous processing
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - JSON
  - AJAX
  - Git
  - Node
- HTML 
  - HTML basics
  - Semantic HTML
- CSS 
  - CSS basics
  - The box model
  - Responsive web design
  
#### Over the next month, we will be studying:
- React and finally building an app.
